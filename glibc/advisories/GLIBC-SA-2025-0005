posix: Fix double-free after allocation failure in regcomp

The regcomp function in the GNU C library version from 2.4 to 2.41 is
subject to a double free if some previous allocation fails. It can be
accomplished either by a malloc failure or by using an interposed
malloc that injects random malloc failures. The double free can allow
buffer manipulation depending of how the regex is constructed.
This issue affects all architectures and ABIs supported by the GNU C
library.
